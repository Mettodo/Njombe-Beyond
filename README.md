# Njombe-Beyond
Hello world! Karibu [Njombe Beyond](https://www.smartcentretanzania.or.tz/index.php/projects/njombe-beyond/)!
We are working to reduce plastic waste in Njombe town through the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) movement, while we test new ways to coordinate human activities. This is one of those experiments: we invite anyone to contribute to Njombe Beyond and get rewarded for doing so.

## How to contribute
You find open issues you can work on here on Github. There are different needs - e.g. marketing, product development or mould design  - but you are also welcome to come up with your own ideas on how to move the project forward (send us an email [here](mailto:hi.njombe@gmail.com)). You can get a sense of where we come from and where we are heading in the "past and future activites" section on our [website](https://www.smartcentretanzania.or.tz/index.php/projects/njombe-beyond/).

## Rewards

### Product & mould designers
Your name will also apear on Precious Plastic Bazaar, on Njombe Beyond´s page, and visitors will know who has designed those beautiful products!

In addition, we pay product and mould designers 20% of their "theoretical" payment. We then share the blueprints online under a "pay what feels right" modality (check previous example [here](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/shipo-smart-centre-tanzania/)): anyone is free to download and use the blueprints and is welcome to pay whatever they feel is right. All the payments we get this way go directly to the designers until 100% of the theoretical payment is reached.  

### Marketing
Sales oriented tasks are rewarded based on sales :) 

And for all the other contribution, we are happy to discuss new arrangements ;)
