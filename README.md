# Njombe-Beyond
Hello world! Karibu [Njombe Beyond](https://www.smartcentretanzania.or.tz/index.php/projects/njombe-beyond/)!
We are working to reduce plastic waste in Njombe town through the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) movement, while we test new ways to coordinate human activities. This is one of those experiments: we invite anyone to contribute to Njombe Beyond and get rewarded for doing so.
## How to contribute
You find open issues you can work on here on Github. There are different needs - e.g. marketing, product development or mould design  - but you are also welcome to come up with your own ideas on how to move the project forward (send us an email [here](mailto:hi.njombe@gmail.com). You can get a sense of where we come from and where we are heading in the "past and future activites" section on our [website](**url**).
